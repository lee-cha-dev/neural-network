# neural-network

THIS IS A SIMPLE LIBRARY TO SIMULATE A NEURAL NETWORK.

THE GOAL IS TO BUILD A LIBRARY THAT WILL HANDLE CREATING CUSTOM/RANDOM NEURAL NETWORKS WITH THE SPEED OF C, 
BUT WITH THE SIMPLICITY THAT IS FOUND WITHIN PYTHON LIBARIES (A TOUCH AMBITIUOS). 

THE END GOAL SHOULD BE FLEXIBILE ENOUGH TO USE FOR ANN, CNN, AND RNN.
- THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE THE NATURE OF PROGRAMMING.

THIS IS VERY MUCH A PROJECT FOR BOTH LEARNING AND GROWING MY SKILLS AND UNDERSTANDING OF AI.
